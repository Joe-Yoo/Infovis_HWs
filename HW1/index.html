            <h2>Overview and Learning Objectives</h2>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">For one day per week (Monday), we will focus on visualization research. We will read research papers on some topic/theme, students will make presentations about the papers, and we will discuss. One goal is to try to develop ideas for new research projects. On the other day per week (Wednesday), we will focus on visualization system/application development. Students will learn how to develop interactive visualization tools using languages and libraries like D3js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">This course is an advanced information visualization course focusing on research within this domain. <strong>Students should already have a good working knowledge of data visualization along the lines of what one would get from taking CS 4460 or CS 6730 at Georgia Tech or equivalent courses.</strong> This course (CS 7450) is <strong>NOT</strong> intended to be a student's first exposure to the data visualization area.</p>
            
            <h2>Textbooks</h2>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">There are no required textbooks for this course. However, there is a collection of <a href="https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/495474/pages/vis-programming-resources">resources</a> that you should find helpful for assignments throughout the course. There are also <a href="#readings">readings</a> that we will cover throughout the course, which are all available while on the GT VPN (or on campus). </p>
        
            <h2>Course Format</h2>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">The course will consist mainly of two parts: reading and discussing research papers about information visualization and learning how to program web-based visualizations (predominantly using d3.js). </p>
            
            <h2>Timeliness</h2>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">All assignments are due at 11:59 pm on Friday. Late work will receive a 10% per day penalty. After 5 days, a 0% will be given, and no submission will be accepted. Too much other work, being gone for the weekend, running out of paper, etc., are not emergencies. It is required to submit a "Class Absence Verification" using the following link AND send advance notification to Alysha Irvin with the instructor cc'ed. Severe emergency situations can be accommodated with flexibility. <a href="https://studentlife.gatech.edu/request-assistance">Request assistance link here</a>. </p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">However, it is understandable that life events and other reasons come up that may require you to miss a deadline. As such, each student is given 2 “<em>late days</em>” that you can use throughout the semester. If you want to use any of your late days, add a note (or comment) to the Canvas submission at the time you submit. You cannot apply late days to assignments at the end of the semester or days after you submit your assignment. These are intended to be used in a situation where life events happen, not to retroactively apply them at the end of the semester. </p>

            <h2>AI Assistant Policy</h2>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">We treat AI-based assistance, such as ChatGPT and Copilot, the same way we treat collaboration with other people: you are welcome to talk about your ideas and work with other people, both inside and outside the class, as well as with AI-based assistants. However, all work you submit must be your own. You should never include in your assignment anything that was not written directly by you without proper citation (including quotation marks and in-line citation for direct quotes). Including anything you did not write in your assignment without proper citation will be treated as an academic misconduct case. If you are unsure where the line is between collaborating with AI and copying AI, we recommend the following heuristics: </p>
            <ul class="syllabus-desc">
                <li><strong>Heuristic 1</strong>: Never hit "Copy" within your conversation with an AI assistant. You can copy your own work into your own conversation, but do not copy anything from the conversation back into your assignment. Instead, use your interaction with the AI assistant as a learning experience, then let your assignment reflect your improved understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Heuristic 2</strong>: Do not have your assignment and the AI agent open at the same time. Similar to the above, use your conversation with the AI as a learning experience, then close the interaction down, open your assignment, and let your assignment reflect your revised knowledge. This heuristic includes avoiding using AI directly integrated into your composition environment: just as you should not let a classmate write content or code directly into your submission, so also you should avoid using tools that directly add content to your submission.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Deviating from these heuristics does not automatically qualify as academic misconduct; however, following these heuristics essentially guarantees your collaboration will not cross the line into misconduct.</p>
        
            <h2>Canvas</h2>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Canvas will be used for electronic submissions for most of the assignments and for recording grades. For contacting the instructor or the TAs, please use Ed Discussion (preferred) or emails.</p>

            <h2>Grading and Assignments</h2>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Final course grades may be curved (but not always). Grades of individual assignments will not be curved. If a curve is given, it will only be curved up (not down). Any regrade requests should be emailed directly to the TAs and need to describe the detailed concern for the regrade.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Grading distributions for this course are:</p>

            <p class="syllabus-desc"><a href="#assignments">Click here</a> to see more details about the assignments.</p>

            <h3>Homework Assignments (HW)</h3>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Details on HW assignments are on the Canvas site for this course. Due dates for each assignment can be found on Canvas and on the course Schedule. Grading distributions can be found on the course Syllabus. Submit all HW assignments on Canvas. Unless indicated by the HW instructions, all HWs are to be completed individually.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">These individual assignments will teach you the basic skills for developing web-based visualizations. You are expected to complete these assignments using d3.js. It is good practice to develop your assignments using some sort of version control. GaTech gives you access to GitHub, which is a good one to use if you haven’t done so already.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">When grading, we will use Google Chrome in Incognito Mode to run your visualizations. Further, when a server is required, we will use a Python server on localhost. When submitting on Canvas, make sure you submit a .zip containing all your files and name it Lastname_Firstname.zip (e.g., Yang_Yalong.zip) unless otherwise mentioned in the assignment.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Warning: There are many existing examples and source code widely available online. While these are great resources for you to learn, note that copying these is considered a breach of the rules from the Office of Student Integrity and will be handled accordingly. Be careful and thoughtful to use these resources responsibly.</p>

            <h3>Class Engagement</h3>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">This is an in-person section of the course, and all students are required and expected to attend class. On research days (Mondays), when other students are presenting papers, everyone should give the presenters their attention and be ready for a discussion afterward. On programming days (Wednesdays), the instructors will present material and then students will engage with interactive labs, so definitely bring your laptop that day.</p>

            <h2>Expectations and Academic Integrity</h2>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Mutual expectations</strong>. At Georgia Tech we believe that it is important to continually strive for an atmosphere of mutual respect, acknowledgement, and responsibility between faculty members and the student body. See <a href="http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/22/Links">this link</a> for an articulation of some basic expectations - that you can have of me, and that I have of you. In the end, simple respect for knowledge, hard work, and cordial interactions will help build the environment we seek. I encourage you to remain committed to the ideals of Georgia Tech while in this class, and always.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Attendance is expected</strong>. Institute-approved absences will be accommodated, as will absences for interviews, conferences, etc. Notify us by email or direct Canvas messages if you will miss class for one of these two reasons (if you feel some other reason for absence is reasonable, email us, but again, in advance).</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Contacting your instructor and TA</strong>. For communication with TAs and Instructors, please prioritize Ed Discussion. If you use email, please include [CS7450] in the subject line.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Collaboration and academic honesty</strong>. Georgia Tech aims to cultivate a community based on trust, academic integrity, and honor. Students are expected to act according to the highest ethical standards. For information on Georgia Tech's Academic Honor Code, please visit <a href="http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/policies/honor-code/">the Honor Code</a> or <a href="http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/18/">the Code of Conduct</a>. Any student suspected of cheating or plagiarizing on a test, assignment, or project will be reported to the Office of Student Integrity, which will investigate the incident and, if needed, identify the appropriate penalty for violations. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you are expected to do coursework on your own. Please double-check AI Assistant Policy on this page.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>In-class use of computers, cell phones and tablets</strong>. Please use your technology appropriately while in class. Using computers. tablets, smartphones, watches, VR headsets, etc., in a way that reinforces the educational context, such as taking notes or visiting a website being discussed, is appropriate. Reading emails, playing games, browsing social media, watching Netflix, doing your HW assignments, purchasing football tickets, web browsing, etc. are not appropriate. Not only does this detract from your learning, it unavoidably distracts those sitting near you. Also, incoming emails and alerts are distracting. Even note-taking on your computer may not be such a great idea: studies have shown that note-taking by hand has been shown to be more efficient for learning (also see this news story), as opposed to a computer, but that’s your call. In short, it’s really in your best interest to take the 75 minutes out of your day, disconnect from the internet, and engage in the course.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Accommodations for students with disabilities</strong>. If you are a student with learning needs that require special accommodation, contact the Office of Disability Services (often referred to as ADAPTS) at http://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/ as soon as possible to make an appointment to discuss your special needs and to obtain an accommodations letter. Please also e-mail your instructor as soon as possible in order to set up a time to discuss your learning needs.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Student Support Services</strong>. In your time at Georgia Tech, you may find yourself in need of support. <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~aendert3/resources/StudentSupport.pdf">Here</a>, you will find some resources to support you both as a student and as a person.</p>

            <h1>Assignments</h1>

            <h2>Homeworks - 30%</h2>
            <h3>HW 1: Web Stack - <em>Due: 2/6/2026 by 11:59 PM EST</em> - 3%</h3>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">For this assignment, you will practice using web stack basics and create a web page. For this, you have two options for what this page should be about: this course or a personal page for yourself. You only have to pick and do one of these. Do not do both. The description for both is below.</p>

            <p><strong>Option 1: Single web page for this course</strong></p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">This course has a combination of material in multiple tabs on Canvas. Specifically, there is the course syllabus (with course information), the schedule table, the readings, and the assignments. Your task for this option is to create a single page, one-stop-shop for all this information.</p>
            <p>To accomplish this, you need to:</p>
            <ol class="assignment-desc">
                <li>Create a single web page with navigation to the sections for each component: syllabus, schedule table, readings, assignments (and description of the assignments)</li>
                <ol class="assignment-desc">
                    <li>Use HTML and CSS styles to change the fonts/look/feel of the site</li>
                    <li>Clicking on the the navigation link at the top of the page should scroll to the correct position on the page.</li>
                    <li>When descriptions of HW assignments are not yet available, just put "details TBD"</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Use Javascript to add elements dynamically based on data. Instead of repeating elements and content in static HTML pages, use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM to add papers dynamically based on a data file.</li>
                <ol class="assignment-desc">
                    <li>Instead of creating a list for all the papers in static HTML, we have a data file for the paper information in a CSV. Use this CSV and parse it using JavaScript to add the elements dynamically to the readings list as part of your webpage. Note that this CSV file is from previous terms and may not match the current reading list, so please feel free to update them but it's not required.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/495474/files/69655149?wrap=1">Reading List (CSV)</a></li>
                </ol>
                <li>Use SVG to create some sort of visual element to show the grade distribution (instead of the simple table/list on the site now)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Option 2: Create a personal webpage for yourself</strong></p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">For this option, your task is to create a webpage for yourself as a researcher. As I'm sure some of you have seen, there are lots of those around used by our colleagues. Some of you may even already have one! More on that below.</p>
            <p>For this page, your goal is to create a single page that shares important information about yourself as a researcher. If you select this option, the requirements for this page include:</p>
            <ol class="assignment-desc">
                <li>Create a single, scrollable web page with categories about you as a researcher. At a minimum, these should be: About (with information about you), Publications (with a list of publications), Research Interests (with a list of interests that you have regarding the research you work on)</li>
                <li>Use JavaScript to set up a way to populate your research papers from a data file. Similar to step 2 in Option 1 above, use JavaScript to dynamically add publications to your publication list based on a data file. The format of the file is up to you. </li>    
                <li>Add some form of SVG to the webpage to show some aspect of your information in visual form (or for design purposes)</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="syllabus-desc"><em>Note: If you already have a web page, you are welcome to use it. However, it must have the components described above (at a minimum). Also, site that are created from other tools (e.g., Wordpress) are not allowed for this assignment (and they likely will not fit the requirements).</em></p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>What to submit:</strong> You should put all the files for your webpage into a single folder, <strong>name that folder using your GTID</strong>,  then create a .zip from the folder.

            <h2>Reading Reflections - 10%</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Throughout the semester, you will complete three reading reflections. These reflections aim to deepen your understanding of visualization research papers and serve as examples for writing your own research proposal.</p>
            <p>Each reflection has a different focus, aligning with the various parts of your research proposal (parts 1-3). Here are some general guidelines for all reflections:</p>
            <ul class="syllabus-desc">
                <li>Don't just repeat the paper. </li>
                <li>Consider the pattern of <strong><em>summary -> interpret -> reflect</em></strong> for the key points of the paper. That means that you should identify one or more key points made in the paper, interpret what these mean, and then reflect more broadly on them. </li>
                <li>Useful to end your reflection document with open-ended research questions, open discussion, etc. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">You may choose to write a reflection on the paper you present or another one; the choice is yours.</p>

            <h3>Reading Reflection - 1 - <em>Due: 1/30/2026 by 11:59 PM EST</em></h3>
            <p>This assignment focuses on the research idea of the paper. Consider the following:</p>
            <ul class="syllabus-desc">
                <li>What did the authors do?</li>
                <li>How did the authors motivate this work? For example, how is it done today, and what are the limitations of current practices? </li>
                <li>What was the authors' approach, and how did they convince others of its success?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Remember, do not simply repeat the content. Use the <strong><em>summary -> interpret -> reflect</em></strong> pattern. Discuss what the authors did well and what could be improved.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Consider this process as a way to learn how to write your <strong>Prototype Part 1</strong> assignment. Taking the paper you read as an example.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Which paper to read:</strong> Choose one paper from the entire reading list. The chosen paper should be different from the papers you use in the other two reading reflections.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>What to submit:</strong>  Submit a PDF of your reflection, 1-2 pages, single-spaced, single-column, with a reasonable font size (~12pt).</p>

            <h3>Reading Reflection - 2 - <em>Due: 2/20/2026 by 11:59 PM EST</em></h3>
            <p>This individual assignment focuses on the literature review section of the paper. While you should briefly describe the research idea, there's no need for extensive detail. Your reflection should include:</p>
            <ul class="syllabus-desc">
                <li><strong>Research Idea:</strong> What was the research idea, and why is it novel and significant? (Briefly)</li>
                <li><strong>Research Idea:</strong></li>
                <ul class="syllabus-desc">
                    <li>What existing work is related to the research idea?</li>
                    <li>What different research directions or sub-areas are described by the authors? Are these comprehensive? Why might another research direction (e.g., X) not be included?</li>
                    <li>What are the representative works closely related to this research? What did they accomplish, and how do they relate to this research idea? Why there is still the need to carry out this work in such contexts? </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Remember, do not simply repeat the content. Use the <strong><em>summary -> interpret -> reflect</em></strong> pattern. Discuss what the authors did well and what could be improved.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Consider this process as a way to learn how to write your <strong>Prototype Part 2</strong> assignment. Taking the paper you read as an example.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Which paper to read:</strong> Choose one paper from the entire reading list. The chosen paper should be different from the papers you use in the other two reading reflections.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>What to submit:</strong>  Submit a PDF of your reflection, 1-2 pages, single-spaced, single-column, with a reasonable font size (~12pt).</p>

            <h3>Reading Reflection - 3 - <em>Due: 3/13/2026 by 11:59 PM EST</em></h3>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><em>TBD</em></p>

            <h2>Research Prototype - 35%</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">The goal of this assignment group (research prototype) is to give you an end-to-end experience of a visualization research project.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">You will write a complete proposal for a potential new research project in information visualization, and produce a preliminary research prototype.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Largely speaking, there are two major parts involved in almost any research project: Ideation (parts 1-2) and Implementation (parts 3-5).</p>
            <p>To complete this proposal, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol class="assignment-desc">
                <li><strong>Initial Ideation & Literature Review:</strong> Develop an initial (broad) research project idea with a clear goal, motivation, and contribution. Then conduct a thorough literature review to highlight the novelty and significance of your topic compared to existing work.</li>
                <li><strong>Polished Ideation:</strong> Narrow down the scope of your research project idea based on the literature review. Make it clear about its <em>novelty</em> and <em>significance</em> of your proposed work.</li>
                <li><strong>Method and Plan:</strong> Create a comprehensive research plan, detailing the methods and setup for your project.</li>
                <li><strong>Prototype:</strong> Implement the research plan.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">By completing these steps, you'll have an almost-ready project that could lead to a conference submission, such as the <a href="https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/info/call-participation/shortpapers" target="_blank">IEEE VIS Short Paper track</a>. You could also use it for an independent study or a PhD project in visualization. Of course, continuing with your proposed project is up to you.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Individual or Team:</strong> You can choose to complete the research prototype individually or as a team (with maximum of 3 students).</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Please sign up your team using the spreadsheet: <a href="https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/yyang3057_gatech_edu/IQCaxkHxhtUdQqiD2mUHmb_AATZXUFz0V-6RRoYq3Ib09q0?e=y4YcGa">CS7450-Spring26-PrototypeTeamSignUp.xlsx</a>.</p>
            
            <p class="syllabus-desc">If you decide to work as a team, in the first submission, a "team agreement" needs to be submitted, including details about how and when to collaborate. For example, the answers to the following questions:</p>
            <ul class="syllabus-desc">
                <li>Who is the team leader?</li>
                <li>How will you communicate?</li>
                <li>How/when will you meet?</li>
                <li>How will you collaborate on implementation?</li>
                <li>How will you deal with non-performing members?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Only the team leader needs to submit for all prototype assignment submissions.</p>

            <h3>Prototype Part 1 - Initial Ideation & Literature Review - <em>Due: 2/13/2026 by 11:59 PM EST</em> - 5%</h3>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">For Part 1, you need to write the first draft of "introduction" and "related work" sections of a research paper to describe your research idea, and what is the current state-of-the-art.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Start by considering how to generate a strong research idea with a scope achievable in 1-2 semesters. Aim for proposals that are neither too simple nor overly complex.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">A good place to start for this is to think about which "type" of research (and thus proposal) you want to focus on.</p>
            <ul class="syllabus-desc">
                <li><strong>New Technique:</strong> Identify a gap for a new visualization or interaction technique. Describe this gap and how your work will address it, including design goals and sketches.</li>
                <li><strong>New User Study:</strong> Identify a knowledge gap in visualization that needs a well-designed study. Outline the gap, research questions, and methodology.</li>
                <li><strong>New Domain Tool:</strong> Consider a domain where visualization could enhance workflow. Describe the existing workflow and how visualization can help.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">The readings in the first three topics focus on one of these types respectively. There are other "types," but these above should get you started. If you are interested in other types, take a look at the <a href="https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/info/call-participation/area-model" target="_blank">Six VIS Areas</a> defined by the IEEE VIS paper submission process. Here is another <a href="https://cmci.colorado.edu/visualab/papers/19-CGA-ContributionTypes.pdf" target="_blank">magazine-styled article explaining various visualization research contributions</a>.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">After identify a broad research idea, it's essential to conduct a thorough literature review of existing work related to your research idea. This helps ensure your idea remains novel and that you're not reinventing the wheel.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Steps for Conducting a Literature Review:</strong></p>
            <ol class="assignment-desc">
                <li>Identify 2-3 relevant sub-directions. It is always a good idea to divide and conquer, which also makes your literature review more structured.</li>
                <li>Search for papers. Considering the following tips:</li>
                <ul class="syllabus-desc">
                    <li>Prioritize papers from reputable venues: <a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2013/a-guide-to-the-quality-of-different-visualization-venues">A Guide to the Quality of Different Visualization Venues</a>.</li>
                    <li>Use the "source" filter from Google Scholar, e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C47&q=network+visualization+source%3A%22Transactions+on+Visualization+and+Computer+Graphics%22&btnG=">limit papers from TVCG</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Read the searched papers.</li>
                <ul class="syllabus-desc">
                    <li>Before reading the full paper, do a quick skim (e.g., reading the abstract and figures) to make sure it is worthy reading.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Summarize them in a good narrative.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">You should read <strong>at least 10</strong> relevant papers and include the discussion of them in your report.</p>
            
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Your proposal will be graded on clarity, thoughtfulness, and articulation.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Writing Tip:</strong> You are also expected to submit a "Reading Reflection" at the same time in a separate assignment. Using your selected paper as an example. Write a similar "introduction" and "related work" for this assignment.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Submission Guidelines:</strong> Submit a 1-2 page document in double-column conference format (title required, no abstract needed) as a PDF. Use the following template for formatting: <a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/">IEEE Template</a>.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Please also include your team agreement as a separate page that DOES NOT need to follow the template.</p>

            <h3>Prototype Part 2 - Polished Ideation & Expanded Literature Review - <em>Due: 2/27/2026 by 11:59 PM EST</em> - 5%</h3>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Oftentimes, after an initial literature review round, researchers want to polish their proposed research idea. Researchers now have a more comprehensive understanding of what has been done in the direction.</p>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">The goal of this part is to make your research idea more specific and concrete, usually with a narrower scope to highlight its novelty. Another goal is to obtain a solid understanding of the significance of your proposed project, and articulate it well.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong> First, expand your literature review, including at least 20 papers in total now, and discuss them in your "related work" section now. Then, revise your "introduction" section to make it crystal-clear about the following questions:</p>
            <ol class="assignment-desc">
                <li>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</li>
                <li>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</li>
                <li>What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?</li>
                <li>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Making sure, the <strong>novelty</strong> and <strong>significance</strong> of your proposed idea is clearly articulated and convincing.</p>
            
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Writing Tip:</strong> take your research reflection assignment as a chance to do a deep analysis of a modal paper.</p>
            
            <p class="syllabus-desc"><strong>Submission Guidelines:</strong> We want you to submit two things:</p>
            <ol class="assignment-desc">
                <li>IEEE format report. Update the content and submit it.</li>
                <li>A 2-min video explaining your ideas, covering the answers to the four questions aforementioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="syllabus-desc">Zip these two files, and submit them together.</p>
